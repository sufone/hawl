Timeline of scholars, empires and events from history (Arabic, then English)

Google charts (https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/timeline) seems best option, though D3 was tempting. Other libraries don't support timelines

Must use hijra date native: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat

Arabic first then English

For informationâ€¦ should get a proper book. Wikipedia can do till then

For data, let's start with CSV since it's easy to handle, then convert into a JSON to feed into the codebase
